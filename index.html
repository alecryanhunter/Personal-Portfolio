                    <p>
                      Hey! My name is Alec (as seen at the top of the page),
                      and I'm currently 24 years old. For now, I'm a line cook
                      at a fancy seafood restaurant, which I do enjoy, but it's
                      hard work. One of the main bonuses of making this transition
                      is being able to get back to doing cooking as a hobby, instead
                      of as work, which allows me to get a lot more creative and
                      free with ideas for dishes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The reason I decided to switch to web development is a
                      multi-faceted one. Chiefly, and most honestly, it's about
                      the money. A line cook's wage will never compare to even a
                      low-end web developer's. The second reason is because it's
                      something I've always wanted to learn how to do. I had no
                      coding experience before starting this journey, but had
                      plenty of interest in it. I'd always been fascinated with
                      the ability of programming to be able to create specific
                      and useful tools, like a website for storing information in
                      a readable and sensible way, or data crunching software that
                      can more easily return results than an Excel spreadsheet.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In my free time, I enjoy video and tabletop games, chiefly
                      roleplaying games. I've got a too-large collection of various
                      systems, and analyzing different dice probabilities is something
                      that made me interested in coding, as it's a difficult problem
                      to solve with just a calculator, pen and paper. I also like
                      cooking, and have a particular fondness for Italian cuisine.
                      I've got two cats, O'Malley, who is seven years old, and Tuna,
                      who is three years old. Both of them keep me company, and keep
                      me on my toes. I also have a vast amount of other hobbies that I
                      try, and fail, to make time for. For example, photography, as all
                      the images on this page are ones I took myself. Or sewing, which
                      I own plenty of fabric and thread for, but not an equivalent
                      amount of finished articles. A charitable way to think of it is a
                      polymath in the making.
