# Bootcamp Challenge Two

## Description

README IN PROGRESS

This is a portfolio of my work for employers to view. It includes a section where I will (eventually) write about myself and put a profile image, as well as links to projects I'm most proud of. It also has links to my contact information.

It has multiple :hover and :active features, as well as transitions.
