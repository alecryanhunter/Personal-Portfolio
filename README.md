# Bootcamp Challenge Two

## Description

This is a portfolio of my work for employers to view. Currently, I have little work to show, but as I progress in the program and in personal projects, I can easily add it to the webpage. There is spots for 5 webpages, with the one I am most proud of displayed more prominently than the others.

This project taught me a lot about CSS styling. My original vision was much grander, but as I progressed I realized I was unable to learn this in the timeframe available to me. This taught me a crucial lesson about setting clear and realistic expectations from the very beginning, often assisted by a drawing tool or other way to roughly block out the structure of the site. I also learned a lot better about how to manage a workflow when building a webpage from scratch. This goes hand-in-hand with the clear layout, but it helps a lot to lay out all the HTML first, and then go through and style everything with CSS, instead of doing one section's HTMl, then it's CSS, then the next section and so on and so forth. The latter way, which is how I started, caused a lot of friction between the different sections of the webpage that took me quite a while to rectify.

In addition to the high-concept workflow and process knowledge I gained, I also learned a lot about specific CSS tools, like flexboxes and positioning. I was able to create a "sticky" sidebar that scrolled with the page, which was the only thing that remained from my original grand vision. I also got a much better understanding of flexbox, specifically using the different orientations alongside a media screen to quickly change the layout with resolution change.

Overall, this was a very challenging but rewarding, and dare I say fun, assignment to work on. I look forward to revising it in the future.
